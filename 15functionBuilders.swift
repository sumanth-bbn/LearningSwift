/*
Function builders in Swift are a powerful feature that allows complex objects to be built using a sequence of statements, somewhat similar to how SwiftUI views are defined. It's actually a compiler feature that is used by certain Swift APIs to provide cleaner, more readable code.

In terms of Python decorators, function builders are a bit different. A Python decorator is a specific type of function that modifies the behavior of other functions or classes. In Python, decorators are used to wrap another function, providing some additional functionality before or after the wrapped function runs.

On the other hand, a Swift function builder is used to transform a block of code into a single expression. The block of code is usually a series of expressions, and the function builder provides a way to combine those into one. Function builders don't modify the behavior of other functions, instead, they're used to create a new object based on a sequence of statements.

Function builders are used extensively in SwiftUI to allow for the declarative syntax that SwiftUI provides. A good example of this is how a VStack or HStack can take multiple views within its initializer closure, and those views are automatically combined into a single composite view.
